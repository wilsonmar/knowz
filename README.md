This repository contains code for a cross-platform mobile app written in React-Native.

Unlike other sample "boilerplate" and "starter" apps on Github
that just throws a string to a blank screen,
this repo provides a full experience:

   * Video splash screen that works offline.
   * Login via Facebook, Twitter, Google, Github.
   * A "Kitchen Sink" of every known GUI element
     (menus, lists, spinners, etc.)

Developers can use this to focus on content for their killer app.

Courses that explain how to program make use of this source code.
In fact, seminars and support is how we fund this app's development.

Testers would especially appreciate this app because it contains
features not available, such as:

   * A button that crashes the app, useful for testing loggging.
   * Tracking of every call with how long the round-trip took.
   * And other features you suggest.
