This repository contains code for a cross-platform mobile app written in React-Native.

Unlike other sample "boilerplate" and "starter" apps on Github
that just throws a string to a blank screen,
this repo provides a full experience:

   * Video splash screen that works offline.
   * Login via Facebook, Twitter, Google, Github.
   * Two-factor authentication
   * API calls to Twillo for SMS, and various other data sources.
   * User preferences (color, greeting, etc.)
   * A "Kitchen Sink" of every known GUI element
     (color picker, menus, lists, spinners, etc.)

This means <strong>developers</strong> can leverage this to focus on content for their killer app.

Courses that explain how to program explain this source code.
In fact, seminars and support is how we fund this app's development.

<strong>Testers</strong> would especially appreciate this app because it contains
features not available in other apps (on purpose, anyway), such as:

   * A button that crashes the app, useful for testing loggging.
   * Tracking of every call with how long the round-trip took.
   * And other features you suggest.

This app enables work on End-to-end integration scripts even before your developers produce custom code.
